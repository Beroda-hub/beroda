###Lab1 for forensic's takeaway###

I completed a lab for forensics class today and used the following: volatility 2.6, the sysinteralsuite to examine a ramp dump (provided by instructor) that listed a system running WINXPSP2. 
Some of the plugins used with the .exe include imageinfo, pslist, psscan, hivelist, shutdowntime, connections, connscan and mbrparser. 

From this lab, I learned how to extract process, registry, storage, and network artifacts from a memory dump, and how each plugin provides a different view of the system state at the time of capture.
It was a good exercise in piecing together system activity and potential evidence from memory.
